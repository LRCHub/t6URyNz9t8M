If all I have is now,
No consequences
Would I go touch the flame
Or would I run for the exit?
I fought this all my life
The blood shedding like never
before
But I finally see your face
It's just a mirror looking back
at me
My reflection is all I see
I don't wanna finish what we
started
I never should've let you in
You thought I was an easy target
Now I know who you are, who the
devil is
You can try to take my salvation
You can try to take everything
I'm not a slave to your
temptation
'Cause I know who you are and
who the devil is
There's nowhere safe to hide
I can feel your presence
But we've been waging war
Since you fell from the heavens
I fought this every night
It feels like I've already been
here before
Well I'm looking into your eyes
And my reflection's looking back
at me
And the devil is all I see
I don't wanna finish what we
started
I never should've let you in
You thought I was an easy target
Now I know who you are, who the
devil is
You can try to take my salvation
You can try to take everything
I'm not a slave to your
temptation
'Cause I know who you are and
who the devil is
I had enough of you, 'cause you
took enough away from me
The lies I've lived became
everything I believe
But the truth is that, the devil
in you is me
The devil in you is me
The devil in you is me
I don't wanna finish what we
started
I never should've let you in
You thought I was an easy target
Now I know who you are, who the
devil is
You can try to take my salvation
You can try to take everything
I'm not a slave to your
temptation
'Cause I know who you are and
who the devil is
